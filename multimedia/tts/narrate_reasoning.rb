# Narration content
narration = [

  "I have successfully implemented the seven tier reasoning depth hierarchy in master.json version 300.5.0.",

  "This system enables granular control over computational intensity and validation depth.",

  "The seven tiers range from think at times one point zero baseline, up to omnithink at times five point zero for multi-domain fusion.",

  "Think deeper at times one point three adds a validation step for medium complexity tasks.",

  "Think hard at times one point eight provides internal consistency testing with double compute for complex logic.",

  "Think harder at times two point five engages multi-temperature synthesis at point one and point five, with brief reflection loops for tradeoff analysis.",

  "Ultrathink at times three engages all ten adversarial personas with dual validation passes, reserved for deep design and unknown unknowns.",

  "Overthink at times three point eight is experimental, performing fifteen times alternative ideation with synthesis loops for research level synthesis.",

  "Omnithink at times five point zero activates RAG integration and agentic decomposition for multi domain fusion across disparate knowledge spaces.",

  "The auto-escalation logic monitors three signals: confidence below zero point seven, gate failures, and cyclomatic complexity above fifteen.",

  "When confidence drops below seventy percent, the system automatically escalates one tier.",

  "When a quality gate fails, it jumps directly to ultrathink mode.",

  "When code complexity exceeds fifteen, it escalates to think harder for additional analysis.",

  "Safety controls prevent accidental resource exhaustion by capping auto-escalation at ultrathink.",

  "Overthink and omnithink require explicit user confirmation, acknowledging their experimental nature and heavy token cost.",

  "The ten adversarial personas include: skeptic, minimalist, performance zealot, security auditor, maintenance developer, junior confused, senior architect, cost cutter, user advocate, and chaos engineer.",

  "Each persona applies a unique lens to validate solutions from different perspectives.",

  "The skeptic questions if we should build this at all.",

  "The minimalist removes everything possible.",

  "The performance zealot obsesses over every microsecond.",

  "The security auditor assumes everything is an attack vector.",

  "The maintenance dev thinks about debugging at three ay em.",

  "The junior confused asks if they cant understand, its too complex.",

  "The senior architect sees the five year implications.",

  "The cost cutter questions every resource.",

  "The user advocate focuses on actual user needs.",

  "The chaos engineer tries to break everything.",

  "When combined with the fifteen alternatives requirement, we achieve four hundred fifty challenge dimensions.",

  "This is calculated as ten personas times fifteen alternatives times three validation checks, equaling four hundred fifty unique combinations.",

  "This exponential barrier prevents premature optimization and ensures robust solutions.",

  "The system mirrors cognitive science principles, extending Kahnemans dual process theory to multiple validation levels.",

  "Lower tiers operate like system one thinking, fast and automatic.",

  "Higher tiers engage system two, slow and deliberate, with increasing metacognitive oversight.",

  "The non-linear budget scaling reflects diminishing returns on token investment.",

  "The jump from think hard at times one point eight to think harder at times two point five represents a qualitative shift from more compute on same approach to multi-temperature synthesis exploring alternative solution spaces.",

  "This implementation has been validated against master.jsons own governance rules.",

  "All seven tiers are present and correctly configured.",

  "The CLI integration supports eight trigger phrases for natural language activation.",

  "The frozen governance has been preserved, with modifications following rule seven: user instructions codified back into master.json.",

  "Version 300.5.0 has been committed to git with a semantic commit message documenting all changes.",

  "The system is now operational and ready for production use.",

  "This concludes my narration of the seven tier reasoning depth implementation."
