🎨 REPLIGEN - Interactive AI Generation
============================================================

What would you like to do?
  1. Generate with LoRA URL      ← Paste any Replicate model URL
  2. Sync models from Replicate  ← Scrape API, store in DB
  3. Search models               ← Query local database
  4. Show statistics             ← View synced models
  5. Run chain workflow          ← Multi-step generation
  6. Exit
```

## LoRA Workflow

1. Select "Generate with LoRA URL"
2. Paste model URL: `replicate.com/owner/model-name`
3. Enter prompt: "cinematic portrait, dramatic lighting"
4. Wait for generation (shows progress with dots)
5. Images saved to `output/owner_model_timestamp/`
6. Optional: Process with postpro for film stock look

## Example
